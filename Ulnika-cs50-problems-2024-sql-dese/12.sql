--A parent asks you for advice on finding the best public school districts in Massachusetts.
--In 12.sql, write a SQL query to find public school districts with above-average per-pupil expenditures
--and an above-average percentage of teachers rated “exemplary”. Your query should return the districts’ names,
--along with their per-pupil expenditures and percentage of teachers rated exemplary.
--Sort the results first by the percentage of teachers rated exemplary (high to low), then by the per-pupil expenditure (high to low).
