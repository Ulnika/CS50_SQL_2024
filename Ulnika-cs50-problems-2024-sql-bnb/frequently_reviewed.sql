/*Frequently Reviewed
In frequently_reviewed.sql, write a SQL statement to create a view named frequently_reviewed.
This view should contain the 100 most frequently reviewed listings, sorted from most- to least-frequently reviewed.
Ensure the view contains the following columns:

id, which is the id of the listing from the listings table.
property_type, from the listings table.
host_name, from the listings table.
reviews, which is the number of reviews the listing has received.

If any two listings have the same number of reviews, sort by property_type (in alphabetical order), followed by host_name (in alphabetical order).
How many reviews does the most frequently reviewed property have?
And who is the host of that property? Use your frequently_reviewed view to find that Tiffanyâ€™s property has 860 reviews.*/
